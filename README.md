# OST Remote iPhone App

OST Remote makes it easy to keep track of athletes as they come into and out of aid stations during endurance events. OST Remote is designed to work at aid stations with intermittent internet connections. Even with no internet connection, OST Remote will store data locally and upload it to opensplittime.org when you return to cellular or WiFi connectivity.

Set up your event on opensplittime.org, then login and upload event data to OST Remote. Travel to your aid station, record runner times, and sync with opensplittime.org whenever circumstances allow.

OST Remote's minimal live entry screen allows you to quickly capture bib numbers and times and then edit them at your convenience before syncing.

Create an account on www.opensplittime.org to get started using OST Remote.
